# Terraform - Unsecure and vulnerable lab

## Purpose

The primary goal of this lab is to provide a hands-on experience for developers, security practitioners, and students to:

- Gain insight into insecure Terraform code patterns.
- Understand the potential risks associated with insecure infrastructure configurations.
- Learn how to apply security best practices to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BreakingPitt/tfsec-vulnerability-lab.git
   ```
## Running tfsec for Security Analysis

To analyze the insecure Terraform code examples using `tfsec`, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `tfsec` installed. You can install it using the following:

   ```bash
   curl -L -o tfsec https://github.com/tfsec/tfsec/releases/latest/download/tfsec-linux-amd64
   chmod +x tfsec
   sudo mv tfsec /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the insecure Terraform code you want to analyze:

    ```bash
    cd tfsec-vulnerability-lab/src/s3
    ```
3. Run `tfsec` against the insecure Terraform code:

    ```bash
    tfsec .
    ```
